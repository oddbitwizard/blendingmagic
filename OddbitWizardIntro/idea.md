# Story Description
In a modern tunnel/corridor, a strong door is reached. Lights flicker, indicators light up, a panel displays a message, a the door starts opening: bars slide, parts turn and slide away.
Beneath the opening lies a dusty room.
Sparks fly from an old cable, and a sign turns on in the dark. Neon comes to life in blue and orange: Oddbit Wizard.
As the sign finishes activating, two lines carry a (visual) signal to the steel blinds behind, revealing a glass bay and the world behind it.

# Parts

The corridor should contain some tubes and low-power sources of light in greenish hues. I'm thinking concrete and rock.

The door should be an improved version of the tests within the current `OddBitwizard.blend`.

The room might work well as a classy den abandonned (wood, marble, gold, obsidian), as a archaeotech storage (concrete, steel) or as a scifi den (white, blue, orange).

Cables should be black/yellow/red.

Activation lines should be flat, with LED dots (same colors as the neon sign, dot goes to steel blinds).

World should be rendered on a surface away (mountain + spires + waterfalls? Huge high-tech megaspire? Neo-incan pyramid? Underwater world?): whatever looks best with minimum effort, since it's not the core idea.
